# Java Concurrency and Data Structures

This repository contains Java code examples and solutions for various topics in concurrency, data structures, algorithms, and design patterns. It is organized into multiple directories, each focusing on a specific area such as concurrency, collections, design patterns, and DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms).

## Directory Structure

- **Collections/**: Examples using Java Collections Framework.
- **Concurrency/**: Multithreading, synchronization, thread pools, deadlocks, livelocks, starvation, semaphores, and more.
- **Design Patterns/**: Classic design patterns like Singleton.
- **DSA/**: Data Structures and Algorithms, including Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and Array/String problems.

## How to Run

This project is designed for use with Visual Studio Code and the Java extension pack.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd java-concurrency
   ```

2. **Open in Visual Studio Code:**
   - Open the folder in VS Code.
   - Use the Run/Debug options or the integrated terminal.

3. **Run a specific example:**
   - Each Java file contains a `main` method.
   - You can run any file directly, for example:
     ```sh
     javac Concurrency/ExampleThread.java
     java Concurrency.ExampleThread
     ```

   - Or use the VS Code launch configurations provided in [.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json).

## Topics Covered

- **Concurrency**: Threads, Runnable, synchronization, thread pools, deadlocks, livelocks, starvation, semaphores, virtual threads, and more.
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and their algorithms.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph traversal (BFS/DFS), and more.
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton and other patterns.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)
- Java Extension Pack for VS Code
